# NWB Loading Example

To use the notebook, first download the data for the first session of the first subject from the following DANDI datasets:
- [Dataset of human medial temporal lobe neurons, scalp and intracranial EEG during a verbal working memory task ](https://dandiarchive.org/dandiset/000574/)
- [
  Dataset of neurons and intracranial EEG from human amygdala during aversive dynamic visual stimulation ](https://dandiarchive.org/dandiset/000576)

The files should be called "sub-01_ses-20161214T171300_behavior+ecephys.nwb" and "sub-01_ses-20140828T132700_ecephys.nwb". Place them in the same directory as the notebook.

For info on how to read NWB files, see the [NWB tutorials](https://pynwb.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/index.html#general-tutorials).
